#Experience
1) It was a fun doing this because it was my first LLM project ever in my life
2) I had 0 knowledge in LLms that is why it was a fun to learn and develope which is necessary for any developer

# Developement Thought Process
1) As I am a full stack developer exp in Next js and Node js so Ik the importtance and performance of NextJs hence I used it for frontend and for
   designing Nextjs comes with built in support for Tailwind CSS and I have hands on Tailwind so Used those for frontend
2) When it comes to backend I have a exp in NestJs which is framework of NodeJS but for AI and LLMs we use python and I was also worked
  on django sometimes so that I thought to use Django for backend so that I dont need to create different backend

# Challanges
1) I had zero knowledge of what langchain and llm are so I gone through some tutorials and learnt from them
2) For the first time It was hard to understand but I read some articles about llms on medium.com and then It was easy for me to implement
3) As I am always curious about Python and Innovation like AI and ML it was a really good and fun experiance while building this application
